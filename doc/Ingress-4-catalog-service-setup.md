# Exposing the catalog-service in our minikube cluster to the local host with an Ingress deployment
In chapter 9 we will implement the API Gateway pattern, whose service will be exposed outside the k8s cluster with an
Ingress configuration. To be able to expose the catalog-service we created at the end of chapter 7 without starting a
port forwarding process for this, we will configure an Ingress for it as a provision until we get to the API Gateway 
implementation. This is all taken from section 9.5.1 & 9.5.2 of the book.
We are working on Linux Ubuntu.

## Understanding the Kubernetes Ingress API and Ingress Controller
- An Ingress manages external access to services in a cluster, typically through the HTTP protocol, it may provide
  - load balancing
  - TSL termination
  - name based virtual hosting
- An Ingress Object acts as an entrypoint into the k8s cluster and can route traffic from a single IP address to multiple
  services running in the cluster.
- We need to create an Ingress manifest file to declare the desired state of the Ingress Object.
- The actual component that enforces all configured rules and routes traffic is the _ingress controller_, which is
  usually built on top of a reverse proxy like NGINX, HAProxy or Envoy.
- here we will use Ingress NGINX, which is available as addon with minikube

## Enable the Ingress addon of minikube with `minikube addons enable ingress -p polar`
- We will need to do this only once as long as we use the same cluster profile set up.
- Make sure minikube is running otherwise start it with `minikube start -p polar`, then run:
```bash
willem@linux-laptop:~/git/cnsia$ minikube addons enable ingress -p polar

You can check everything running under the `ingress-nginx` namespace with `kubectl get all -n ingress-nginx`:
```bash
willem@linux-laptop:~/git/cnsia$ kubectl get all -n ingress-nginx

```
Alternatively, you can monitor these from
- Service > Ingress Classes > nginx
- Cluster > Cluster Role Bindings >
  - ingress-nginx
  - ingress-nginx-admission
- Cluster > Cluster Roles >
  - ingress-nginx
  - ingress-nginx-admission

## Defining the ingress manifest file and deploying it within the `minikube -p polar` cluster
see [../catalog-service/k8s/ingress.yml](../catalog-service/k8s/ingress.yml) for the definition
and to deploy it execute:
```bash
willem@linux-laptop:~/git/cnsia/catalog-service$ kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress.yml 
ingress.networking.k8s.io/polar-ingress created
willem@linux-laptop:~/git/cnsia/catalog-service$
```

Now you can see the deployed ingress on the dashboard at Service > Ingresses > polar-ingress
- Under _resource information_ you see
  - Ingress class name is __nginx__
  - Endpoints is a singe ip address `192.168.49.2`
- Under _Rules_ you can see that all URLs `/` are forwarded to the service named `catalog-service` on service port 80

- This endpoint ip address is important, because on our linux machine all calls to the service should start with
  `http://192.168.49.2/`
- Another way to discover this ip address is with `minikube ip -p polar`

## Test it with a browser, Postman or Insomnia
- previously, after the port forwarding `kubectl port-forward service/catalog-service 9001:80` we could reach all 
  APIs from [http://localhost:9001/](http://localhost:9001/)
- Now with the Ingress deployed we can reach all APIs from [http://192.168.49.2/](http://192.168.49.2/)
  - a GET request to [http://192.168.49.2/](http://192.168.49.2/) will reach the home page
  - a GET request to [http://192.168.49.2/books](http://192.168.49.2/books) will show a list of all books
